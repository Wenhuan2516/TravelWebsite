                        The Portland Art Museum in Portland, Oregon, United States, was founded in 1892, making it one of the oldest art museums on the
                         West Coast and seventh oldest in the US. Upon completion of the most recent renovations, the Portland Art Museum became one 
                         of the 25 largest art museums in the US. The permanent collection has more than 42,000 works of art, and at least one major traveling 
                         exhibition is usually on show. The Portland Art Museum features a center for Native American art, a center for Northwest art,
                          a center for modern and contemporary art, permanent exhibitions of Asian art, and an outdoor public sculpture garden. 
                          The Northwest Film Center is also a component of Portland Art Museum.

                        The Portland Japanese Garden is a traditional Japanese garden occupying 12 acres, located within Washington Park 
                        in the West Hills of Portland, Oregon, United States. It is operated as a private non-profit organization, 
                        which leased the site from the city in the early 1960s. As a Japanese garden, the desired effect is to realize 
                        a sense of peace, harmony, and tranquility and to experience the feeling of being a part of nature. 
                        Three of the essential elements used to create the garden are stone, the "bones" of the landscape; 
                        water, the life-giving force; and plants, the tapestry of the four seasons.Japanese garden designers fe
                        el that good stone composition is one of the most important elements in creating a well-designed garden.
